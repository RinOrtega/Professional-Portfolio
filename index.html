                    and learn any and all information that is placed in my path. I am brand new to coding, but have high
                    hopes as to what I can learn and accomplish. My dream career lies within game design and development
                    and my hope is the course I am taking is the path that can lead me to that career. I have a strong
                    determination to achieve and perfect my ablities in order to obtain my goal.
                    This project is one of many steps to my goal. My current work, resume, and contact information can be
                    found within this portfolio.'
